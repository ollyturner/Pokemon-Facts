However, the Player is still able to start the sequence where they can again obtain one of the three Pokémon depending on their choice.

As the Player can only trigger the event with one event Arceus and one Hall of Origin Arceus, it is impossible to obtain all three Pokemon.

#350. In the data of the Generation IV Pokémon Games, there are sprites and Shiny sprites for a ???-type Arceus. However since there is no Plate that will grant Arceus the ???-type, and with the removal of the ???-type from Generation V onwards, these sprites remain unused.

#356. Although Celebi is genderless, the Celebi that appears in Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon is referred to as male, and the Shiny Celebi that appears in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explores of Time/Explorers of Darkness is referred to as female.

#357. In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team, if the game generates an invalid floor (due to all the rooms not connecting) it will generate a new one. If the game goes 10 times in a row without generating a valid floor, it will generate a single room Monster House as the entire floor.

#358. In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team, if the Player hacks or cheats to go outside of the rooms’ borders they will be warped to a valid part of the map instead.

#359. Although only Unowns N, I, C, E, !, and ? are available in Pokémon Shuffle, data for all Unown forms exist in the game.

#360. Between 12:00pm and 3:00pm on September 30th 2006, Players could visit Toys“R”Us stores in the US where they could receive an event Mew for their Generation III Pokémon game. This was done by trading for it with staff who were given special Pokémon FireRed cartridges programmed with a save file containing the Mew by Nintendo.

However due to the trade restrictions of the Generation III games, any Pokémon Emerald game that hasn’t received the National Pokédex could not trade for the Mew.

#361. Pansage, Pansear, and Panpour have identical base stats. Their evolved forms, Simisage, Simisear, and Simipour also have identical base stats.

#362. In Pokémon Go, as long as it can learn the move, the moveset that Smeargle has when captured is the same Fast Attack and Charged Attack (1st only) as the Pokémon that it photobombed in the AR Camera.

#364. Genesect’s unique signature move, Techno Blast, changes type depending on the Drive of the holder, without which Techno Blast is a Normal-type. Because of this the Bug/Steel-type Genesect cannot gain a same-type attack bonus from Techno Boost without Genesect’s type being changed.

However if Smeargle uses Sketch to copy Techno Blast, it will permanently learn the move, and due to Smeargle’s Normal-type, it can gain STAB whilst using it.

#365. In Generations II & III, as well as in its official artwork, and the majority of its TCG appearances, Mantine is shown with a Remoraid attached it. From Generation IV onwards its in-game sprite is shown without a Remoraid.

However it’s artwork for Pokémon HOME (which is based on its official artwork) once again shows a Remoraid attached to Mantine, and for the first time, if the Mantine is Shiny, the Remoraid will also be Shiny.
